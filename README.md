ScrapeGraphAI is a *web scraping* python library based on LangChain which uses LLM and direct graph logic to create scraping pipelines for websites and documents.
Just say which information you want to extract and the library will do it for you!

## üìñ Documentation

The documentation for ScrapeGraphAI can be found [here](https://scrapegraph-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Check out also the docusaurus [documentation](https://scrapegraph-doc.onrender.com/).

## üíª Usage

### Case 1: Extracting information using a prompt

You can use the `SmartScraper` class to extract information from a website using a prompt.

The `SmartScraper` class is a direct graph implementation that uses the most common nodes present in a web scraping pipeline. For more information, please see the [documentation](https://scrapegraph-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from scrapegraphai.graphs import SmartScraperGraph

load_dotenv()
openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_APIKEY")

# Define the configuration for the graph
graph_config = {
    "llm": {
        "api_key": openai_key,
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    },
}

# Create the SmartScraperGraph instance
smart_scraper_graph = SmartScraperGraph(
    prompt="List me all the titles and project descriptions"
    file_source="https://perinim.github.io/projects/",  # also accepts a local file path
    config=graph_config
)

result = smart_scraper_graph.run()
print(result)

```

The output will be a dictionary with the extracted information, for example:

```bash
{
    'titles': [
        'Rotary Pendulum RL'
        ],
    'descriptions': [
        'Open Source project aimed at controlling a real life rotary pendulum using RL algorithms'
        ]
}
```
